<!--
  In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
  Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
  that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

  This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
  No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

  If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
  the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

  <li>
    I did some codecademy and freecodecamp stuff one summer, but unfortunately never got around to doing anything
    more with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have an idea of tags and such, but github is totally new to me so I've been trying not to fall behind with the
    push/pull/commit stuff
  </li>
  <li>
    It was alot easier after seeing you fork and clone the in class assignment, I just need to spend some time which
    is in short supply.
